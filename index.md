## About Me

I’m a senior AI/ML leader with over a decade of experience architecting scalable, mission-driven systems for climate resilience and operational decision support. As CTO at Space-Eyes, I lead our NASA Ignite-funded FireWatch initiative, an AI-powered wildfire prediction platform that integrates computer vision and multi-source geospatial data to deliver real-time risk intelligence.  
Before FireWatch, I spearheaded the development of SeaWatch, a maritime domain awareness system that fused SAR and EO satellite imagery with advanced object detection models to deliver near real-time ship classification and threat monitoring.  
My leadership spans multiple domains, having built end-to-end AI/ML pipelines across healthcare, fintech, and natural resources. My academic foundation lies in the statistical integration of micrometeorological flux data with Landsat satellite observations to model biophysical processes, deepening my understanding of complex environmental systems.  
A former U.S. Army Reservist with 8 years of service, I bring a mission-first mindset, technical rigor, and cross-disciplinary leadership to every role. I’m driven to apply this expertise within organizations advancing the frontier of AI for public safety, environmental intelligence, and global resilience.
